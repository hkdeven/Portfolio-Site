# Hello, Good Evening, and Welcome
Welcome to the innards of my freshest portfolio site, version 3.0.  [makecodenotwar.co][1]

## Installation
If you want to run this site locally:

- `git clone` it somewhere and cd into that folder
- Create a file called `_config_local.yml` with the following contents:
  ```
  production: false
  ```
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `bundle exec rake db:create`
- Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
- Party. Like it's 1999.

## Who This Repo is For
This repo is mostly for me. I, like many of you, host my code on GitHub for reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind. Beyond my own needs, I have also open-sourced this repo for you, the reader (and most likely developer), to explore the things that make my site tick and hopefully pass along some inspirational nuggets.
